        <h1>The joys of web development</h1>

        <h2>Things have changed a lot since I first started messing around in this...</h2>

        <h3>From tool availability to free resources, it's never been easier to get into!</h3>

        <h4>I love web development and I think this course will further cement that!</h4>

        <p>I started working with HTML (on a super basic level) in middle school back in 2004. I used early Microsoft Word to "publish" basic webpages that I could share with my friends.</p>

        <p>Fast forward about sixteen years, and things have gotten SO easy for people looking to pursue this as a career to find resources to learn. Resources like W3 Schools and Codecademy make it super easy to learn more about web development and how to use it effectively to make beautiful web designs and responsive pages.</p><br>
