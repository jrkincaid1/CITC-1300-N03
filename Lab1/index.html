        <h1>Why the Legend of Zelda is the best video game franchise</h1>
        <p>The Legend of Zelda has been around for thirty-five years this year. It is an awesome series with a fantasy style that offers super deep lore and satisfying gameplay. I enjoy it mainly for the lore, and all sorts of theories that can be developed from it. There are all sorts of awesome theories that can be made from such a diverse set of stories.</p>
